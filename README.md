# `ChadBot`
A simple discord that does a lot a random things. _(Very badly written since OOP-fying it, I'll try to make to code more refined shortly)_

It uses `discord.py 2.0`( https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/projects/3  ,still in beta), for Button and Thread support .The command character is `]`

##Structure of the Project
So for now there are three cogs(or classes) organised into three different files:

`bot_main.py` is the like the main function of the whole project

-`bot_simpleFunctions.py` has tasks like the saying hi and tic tac toe using Buttons

-`bot_messageCounter.py` checks the activity throughout the Server, and in its status displays the most active channel

-`bot_threads.py` keeps the thread from being archived

_Fork my project  use `]help` to learn about each command `Chadbot` can do_ ðŸ˜‰. _It's open source, I'd be glad if someone were to learn something from this. I've used plenty github examples to learn a lotta stuff,would be great to contribute back._ 

###_Thanks to all the folks at the discord server discord.py (https://discord.gg/dpy) for helping me debug my code_
